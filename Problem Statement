(a) Optical character recognition (OCR)
How does the the classification error of the 1-Nearest Neightbor for the MNIST dataset change with the 
number of training examples? Plot the n-fold cross validation error for 1000 training examples where
n = [3; 10; 50; 100; 1000]. 
(b) Iris plant recognition
Within the working directory, run iris1NNboundary in Octave or include("iris1NNboundary.jl") in Julia to 
produce a plot of the decision boundary of 1-Nearest Neighbors classifier. 
The iris data set has 150 examples and 3 classes. Now randomly choose m examples, m = [10; 20; 30; 50]
and flip the class label of each of the examples. For instance if the true class label of example i is 1
then replace the class label with either 2 or 3. Now we will have 4 modified datasets. For each of the
modified datasets, run the k-NN algorithm with k = 3 and then plot the decision boundary. Also report
the training error.
